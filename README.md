# tkinter-tutorial
Python 3 code supporting my tkinter tutorial for senior school students. 
The tutorial covers basic features to build simple business applications. grid() layout used in most cases.

1. Window setup
2. Layout (geometry managers)
3. Widgets. I don't cover them all, but the most popular
4. Mouse input
5. Keyboard input
etc.
